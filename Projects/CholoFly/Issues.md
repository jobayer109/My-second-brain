# Landing:
### Hero section:
##### Laptop / Computer:
- Header items has no hover effect.
- The background image does not convey the proper message to the user.
- A storytelling video can be considered.
- Content (Texts) hierarchy issue

- Input field validation messages are not showing properly.

##### Mobile Device:
- There is no hero section. Nothing is mentioned about the service.

## More issues:
- Why the button color is different instead of following brand color?
- Section title font-size are not same. 
- Here, the orange-red color is overly highlighted rather than the brand color. I don't know what the purpose of this is.
- When the user is not logged in, it would be better to keep the 'Messages' and 'Notification' buttons disabled. Otherwise, the user gets confused after clicking them. I also faced the same issue. (For mobile device) â˜º
