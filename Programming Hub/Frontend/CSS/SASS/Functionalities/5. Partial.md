## Two types of directories
- base
- utils

##  Create Partials
Partials are named with a leading underscore (`_`):
- `_variables.scss` 
- `_mixins.scss` 
- `_base.scss`
- `_components.scss`

## File manage by `@forword` and `@use`
### `@forward`
The `@forward` rule allows you to **load** a Sass stylesheet and make its contents available to other stylesheets that import the current file.

### `@use
The `@use` rule allows you to **access / use** a Sass stylesheet and make its contents available to other stylesheets that import the current file.
