Tuples in TypeScript are a special type of array with a fixed number of elements, where each element has a specific type. They’re useful for representing structured data where the order and type of each element are predictable.

#### Syntax
To define a tuple, specify the types of elements in a specific order inside square brackets:

```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];
```

Here, `person` is a tuple with exactly two elements: the first must be a `string`, and the second must be a `number`.

#### Key Features
- **Fixed Length**: Tuples have a fixed number of elements, unlike regular arrays.
- **Typed Elements**: Each position in the tuple has a predefined type.

#### Common Use Cases
- Returning multiple values from a function:
  ```typescript
  function getUserInfo(): [string, number] {
    return ["Alice", 30];
  }
  ```
- Representing structured data like coordinates or RGB values:
  ```typescript
  let coordinates: [number, number] = [10, 20];
  let color: [number, number, number] = [255, 100, 50];
  ```

#### Limitations
Tuples can’t be resized, and attempting to add or remove elements will result in a TypeScript error. However, tuple elements can be modified if mutable.

Tuples provide better type safety and are helpful for working with predictable data structures.
