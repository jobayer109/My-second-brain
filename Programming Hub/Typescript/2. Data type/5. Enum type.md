Enums, short for *enumerations*, bring clarity and control to code by grouping related constants under a single type. They are particularly useful for representing a fixed set of options, like roles, states, or directions, and come in three main types:

### 1. **Numeric Enums**
   Numeric enums use numbers for each option, either auto-assigned starting from `0` or explicitly set. They’re compact and efficient, great for values that don’t need to be descriptive.

   ```typescript
   enum Direction {
     North,    // 0
     East,     // 1
     South,    // 2
     West      // 3
   }
   ```

   *With explicit values:*

   ```typescript
   enum Direction {
     North = 1,
     East = 2,
     South = 3,
     West = 4
   }
   ```

### 2. **String Enums**
   String enums add readability by using descriptive text, making the code easier to understand and debug. They’re ideal for options that should be human-readable.

   ```typescript
   enum UserRole {
     Admin = "ADMIN",
     Editor = "EDITOR",
     Viewer = "VIEWER"
   }
   ```

   Here, `UserRole.Admin` is `"ADMIN"`, which is more descriptive than a number, especially for logging or error messages.

### 3. **Heterogeneous Enums**
   Heterogeneous enums allow a mix of numeric and string values in the same enum, though they’re less common and can be harder to maintain. They’re useful for unique cases where both types are needed together.

   ```typescript
   enum Status {
     Active = 1,
     Inactive = "INACTIVE",
     Pending = 2
   }
   ```

Enums encapsulate options, making code safer, more readable, and free of "magic numbers" or strings. By grouping related constants, they enhance code maintainability, especially in large applications.
