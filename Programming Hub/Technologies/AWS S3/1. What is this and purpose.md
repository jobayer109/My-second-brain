**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is an object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is highly scalable, secure, and cost-effective, allowing users to store and manage large volumes of data with ease.

### Key Features and Purposes of AWS S3:

1. **Object Storage**:
   - S3 stores data as "objects" in "buckets," which function like directories. An object consists of data, metadata, and a unique identifier, making it easy to manage and retrieve specific files.
   - Unlike traditional file storage systems, S3 is an object-based storage, meaning each file or "object" is stored with its own metadata and ID, rather than a hierarchical file structure.
