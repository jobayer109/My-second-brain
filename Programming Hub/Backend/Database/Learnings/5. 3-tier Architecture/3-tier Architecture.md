---

#### Definition
3-tier architecture is a client-server model that separates the application into three distinct layers: presentation, application logic, and data storage. This structure enhances scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

#### Components
1. **Presentation Tier**:
   - The user interface layer where users interact with the application.
   - Displays data and sends user commands to the application layer.
   - **Examples**: Web browsers, mobile apps, desktop applications.

2. **Application Tier (Logic Tier)**:
   - The middle layer that processes user inputs and applies business logic.
   - Acts as a mediator between the presentation and data tiers.
   - **Examples**: Web servers, application servers (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Node.js).

3. **Data Tier**:
   - The back-end layer where data is stored and managed.
   - Handles database operations, including data retrieval and storage.
   - **Examples**: Database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

#### Workflow
1. The user interacts with the presentation tier.
2. The presentation tier sends requests to the application tier.
3. The application tier processes the requests, interacts with the data tier if necessary, and sends responses back to the presentation tier.
4. The presentation tier displays the data to the user.

#### Advantages
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each tier focuses on specific responsibilities, making development easier.
- **Scalability**: Each tier can be scaled independently to handle increased loads.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one tier do not directly affect others, facilitating easier updates and maintenance.
- **Flexibility**: Different technologies can be used for each tier.

#### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: More components increase system complexity.
- **Performance**: Multiple tiers may introduce latency in communication between layers.
- **Cost**: Development and maintenance can be more expensive due to the need for specialized skills.

#### Use Cases
- Large enterprise applications.
- Web applications with complex business logic.
- Systems requiring high scalability and maintainability.

#### Summary
3-tier architecture provides a structured approach to application design by separating the presentation, application logic, and data storage layers. This separation enhances scalability and maintainability, making it suitable for large and complex applications. However, it also introduces complexity and potential performance issues.
