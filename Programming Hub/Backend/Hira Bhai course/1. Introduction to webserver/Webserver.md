## ðŸ“Œ What is a Web Server?

A **Web Server** is a software or hardware system that accepts incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from clients (usually browsers) and returns responses such as web pages, static files, or data.

### âœ… Key Responsibilities:
- Handling HTTP/HTTPS requests
- Serving static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Routing API requests to application logic
- Acting as a reverse proxy or load balancer
- Managing SSL, caching, and logging

## ðŸš€ Popular Web Server Technologies

| Web Server        | Highlights                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apache**        | Most widely used, open-source, highly configurable             |
| **Nginx**         | Lightweight, fast, great for static content & reverse proxy    |
| **Node.js**       | JavaScript runtime; used with Express/Fastify for dynamic apps |
| **LiteSpeed**     | Fast, drop-in replacement for Apache                           |
| **Tomcat**        | Java-based server, handles JSP and servlets                    |
| **Caddy**         | Modern server with auto HTTPS (Letâ€™s Encrypt)                  |
| **Microsoft IIS** | Native to Windows Server; ideal for .NET apps                  |

## ðŸ“˜ Web Server vs Application Server

### ðŸ”¹ Key Differences

|Feature|Web Server|Application Server|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JS)|Runs business logic, serves dynamic content|
|**Content Type**|Static|Dynamic|
|**Common Examples**|Nginx, Apache|Node.js, Spring Boot, Django, .NET Core|
|**Protocols**|HTTP, HTTPS|HTTP + others (JMS, RMI, gRPC etc.)|
|**Output**|HTML, CSS, JS, images|JSON, XML, dynamic HTML|

### ðŸ§  Simple Analogy

> Web Server = **Gatekeeper**  
> Application Server = **Worker Inside**

- Web Server handles requests and either serves static files or forwards them.

- Application Server processes logic, connects to databases, and returns computed responses.

### ðŸŽ¯ Real-world Flow

```plaintext
[ Client Browser ]
â†“
[ Web Server: Nginx / Apache ]
â†“
[ Application Server: Node.js / Django / Spring Boot ]
â†“
[ Database or External APIs ]
```

### ðŸ§¾ Summary

- âœ… Web server: lightweight, fast, ideal for serving static resources.

- âœ… Application server: heavier, used for logic-intensive and data-driven operations.


> âš¡ **One-liner**:  
> _Web Server serves, Application Server computes._
