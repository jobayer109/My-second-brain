## **What is JavaScript** ?
- High level - We don't worry about complex memory management.
- Multi-paridgm - We can use different style like **imperative** and **declarative.**
- Object-oriented - Based on object, to storing most kinds of data.

## **Why is JavaScript a Multi-Paradigm Language?**
**Multi-paradigm language**: A programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms (approaches/styles of programming). A paradigm can be defined as an approach to solving a problem.

### **Paradigms in JavaScript** 

##### 1. **Imperative Programming**
   - **Definition**: Focuses on how to execute, detailing steps for the computer to follow.
   - **Characteristics**: Use of statements, loops, conditionals.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     let total = 0;
     for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
         total += i;
     }
     console.log(total);
     ```

##### 2. **Declarative Programming**
   - **Definition**: Focuses on what to execute, describing what the program should accomplish.
   - **Characteristics**: Emphasis on expressions and declarations over statements.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
     console.log(sum);
     ```

---
##### 3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **Definition**: Organizes code into objects that contain both data and methods.
   - **Characteristics**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     class Animal {
         constructor(name) {
             this.name = name;
         }

         speak() {
             console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
         }
     }

     class Dog extends Animal {
         speak() {
             console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
         }
     }

     const dog = new Dog('Rex');
     dog.speak(); // Rex barks.
     ```

---
##### 4. **Functional Programming (FP)**
   - **Definition**: Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding changing-state and mutable data.
   - **Characteristics**: First-class functions, higher-order functions, immutability, pure functions.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const double = x => x * 2;
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
     const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(double);
     console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
     ```

---
### Key Features Supporting Multi-Paradigm Nature

- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
- **Prototypal Inheritance**: Objects can inherit properties directly from other objects.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- **Closures**: Functions that capture variables from their lexical scope.
- **Modules**: Encapsulation and separation of code.
