### 1. **What is Git?**
   - **Answer**: Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of their projects. Git is fast and actionable in online and offline both mode.

### 2. **What is GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows developers to host repositories, collaborate, and manage projects online.

### 3. **What is a repository in Git?**
   - **Answer**: A repository (repo) is a storage space where your project and its history (versions, commits) are stored. It can be local (on your machine) or remote (on GitHub).

### 4. **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: Git is a version control tool for tracking changes in code, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration tools like pull requests, issues, and web hosting.

### 5. **How do you clone a repository?**
   - **Answer**: Use the command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
     This creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

### 6. **What is a commit in Git?**
   - **Answer**: A commit is a snapshot of changes made in your repository. It acts as a save point in your project, capturing a specific state of the code.

### 7. **How do you create a new branch in Git?**
   - **Answer**: You can create a new branch using the command:
     ```bash
     git branch <branch-name>
     ```
     Or, you can create and switch to it with:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```

### 8. **What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `git fetch` downloads changes from the remote repository but doesn’t merge them into your working code.
     - `git pull` fetches the changes and merges them directly into your local branch.

### 9. **How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?**
   - **Answer**: Git will indicate files with conflicts. You need to open those files, manually edit the conflicting parts, and then stage and commit the resolved files:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-file>
     git commit
     ```

### 10. **What is a pull request (PR) on GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. You create a PR to let others review and discuss your code before merging it into the main branch.

### 11. **What is a fork in GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: A fork is a personal copy of someone else’s repository. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

### 12. **What is a Git tag?**
   - **Answer**: A Git tag is a reference to a specific commit in your repository. It’s often used to mark release points or important milestones in your project.

### 13. **What is `.gitignore`?**
   - **Answer**: The `.gitignore` file specifies which files or directories Git should ignore and not track. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build outputs, or sensitive information.

### 14. **How do you revert a commit in Git?**
   - **Answer**: You can use the command:
     ```bash
     git revert <commit-hash>
     ```
     This creates a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit. For a complete undo, you might use:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard <commit-hash>
     ```

### 15. **What is the difference between `git rebase` and `git merge`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `git rebase` moves or combines commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.
     - `git merge` combines the histories of two branches, which can create a merge commit and potentially a more complex history.

### 16. **How do you check the status of your working directory in Git?**
   - **Answer**: Use the command:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
     This shows the status of changes, including untracked, modified, and staged files.

### 17. **What is a Git remote?**
   - **Answer**: A remote is a reference to a version of your repository that is hosted on a server. Common remote names include `origin`, which is typically the default name for your primary remote repository.

### 18. **How do you stage files for commit in Git?**
   - **Answer**: Use the command:
     ```bash
     git add <file-name>
     ```
     or to stage all changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

### 19. **What does `git diff` do?**
   - **Answer**: `git diff` shows the changes between the working directory and the index (staged changes), or between different commits.

### 20. **How do you delete a branch in Git?**
   - **Answer**: To delete a local branch:
     ```bash
     git branch -d <branch-name>
     ```
     To delete a remote branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin --delete <branch-name>
     ```
