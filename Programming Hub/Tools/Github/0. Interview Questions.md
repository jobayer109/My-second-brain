### 1. **What is Git?**
   - **Answer**: Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of their projects.

### 2. **What is GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows developers to host repositories, collaborate, and manage projects online.

### 3. **What is a repository in Git?**
   - **Answer**: A repository (repo) is a storage space where your project and its history (versions, commits) are stored. It can be local (on your machine) or remote (on GitHub).

### 4. **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: Git is a version control tool for tracking changes in code, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration tools like pull requests, issues, and web hosting.

### 5. **How do you clone a repository?**
   - **Answer**: Use the command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
     This creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

### 6. **What is a commit in Git?**
   - **Answer**: A commit is a snapshot of changes made in your repository. It acts as a save point in your project, capturing a specific state of the code.

### 7. **How do you create a new branch in Git?**
   - **Answer**: You can create a new branch using the command:
     ```bash
     git branch <branch-name>
     ```
     Or, you can create and switch to it with:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <branch-name>
     ```

### 8. **What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `git fetch` downloads changes from the remote repository but doesn’t merge them into your working code.
     - `git pull` fetches the changes and merges them directly into your local branch.

### 9. **How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?**
   - **Answer**: Git will indicate files with conflicts. You need to open those files, manually edit the conflicting parts, and then stage and commit the resolved files:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-file>
     git commit
     ```

### 10. **What is a pull request (PR) on GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. You create a PR to let others review and discuss your code before merging it into the main branch.


### 11. **What is a fork in GitHub?**
   - **Answer**: A fork is a personal copy of someone else’s repository. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

### 12. **What is a Git tag?**
   - **Answer**: A Git tag is a reference to a specific commit in your repository. It’s often used to mark release points or important milestones in your project.

### 13. **What is `.gitignore`?**
   - **Answer**: The `.gitignore` file specifies which files or directories Git should ignore and not track. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build outputs, or sensitive information.

### 14. **How do you revert a commit in Git?**
   - **Answer**: You can use the command:
     ```bash
     git revert <commit-hash>
     ```
     This creates a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit. For a complete undo, you might use:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard <commit-hash>
     ```

### 15. **What is the difference between `git rebase` and `git merge`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `git rebase` moves or combines commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.
     - `git merge` combines the histories of two branches, which can create a merge commit and potentially a more complex history.

### 16. **How do you check the status of your working directory in Git?**
   - **Answer**: Use the command:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
     This shows the status of changes, including untracked, modified, and staged files.

### 17. **What is a Git remote?**
   - **Answer**: A remote is a reference to a version of your repository that is hosted on a server. Common remote names include `origin`, which is typically the default name for your primary remote repository.

### 18. **How do you stage files for commit in Git?**
   - **Answer**: Use the command:
     ```bash
     git add <file-name>
     ```
     or to stage all changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

### 19. **What does `git diff` do?**
   - **Answer**: `git diff` shows the changes between the working directory and the index (staged changes), or between different commits.

### 20. **How do you delete a branch in Git?**
   - **Answer**: To delete a local branch:
     ```bash
     git branch -d <branch-name>
     ```
     To delete a remote branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin --delete <branch-name>
     ```

These should give you a more comprehensive view of Git and GitHub topics you might need to be familiar with for interviews.
