### 🔸 init
`git init` is a command used to create a new Git repository. Here's a brief explanation:

### What `git init` Does:

1. **Creates a New Repository**: It initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This means Git will start tracking changes to the files in this directory.

2. **Creates a `.git` Directory**: It sets up a `.git` directory in your project folder. This directory contains all the metadata and version history for your Git repository, including configuration files, hooks, and information about the commits.

3. **Prepares for Version Control**: After running `git init`, you can start tracking files, making commits, and using other Git commands to manage the version history of your project.

### Usage Example:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
```

After executing `git init`, you'll be able to use other Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to manage your project.
