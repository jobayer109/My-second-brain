	- If there is text in the output, it will show **"Rephrase"** button instead of **"Paraphrase"** conditionally. 
	
	-  When a user pastes any text into the input field, the system will use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to detect the type of content (e.g., Medical, Technical, Legal, etc.). Based on the detected content type, the system will paraphrase the text while maintaining proper indentation and formatting to preserve the original content structure and theme.

	- The system should detect and handle content duplication to ensure the generated paraphrased output is original and unique.

	- When users paste content with multiple paragraphs into the input section, the system must maintain the original paragraph gaps and line breaks.
    
	- Currently, multiple paragraphs merge into a single paragraph‚Äîthis should be fixed to retain proper formatting.
        
- üîí **Freeze Word Functionality**:
