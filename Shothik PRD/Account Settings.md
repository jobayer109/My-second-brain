The **Account Settings** section of Shothik AI is where users manage their personal and billing information. It consists of two tabs:

- **General Tab**: Allows users to update personal details such as name, address, and profile picture.
    
- **Billing Tab**: Provides users with access to their subscription plan, invoice history, and billing-related actions.
    

This combined PRD outlines the functional, design, and user experience requirements for both tabs to ensure consistency, usability, and responsiveness across all platforms.
