#  Paraphrase
**Objective:** Rewrite text with different tone, sentence structure, and improved readability.

### **Layout Breakdown**

The interface is split into **three main sections**:

####  **Top Bar (Global Options)**

- **Language Switcher** (Top-left):
    
    - Allows switching between English, Bangla, or more languages using the dropdown. English will be selected by default. 
        
- **Tone/Modes Tab** (Below Language Switcher):
    
    - Includes various rephrasing tones:
        - ✅ Free: **Standard**, **Fluency**
        - 🔒 Premium: **Formal**, **Academic**, **News**, **Simple**, **Creative**, **Short**, **Long**
            
    - **Locked icons:** indicate that an upgrade is needed. Free users cannot use the locked modes but can still view them and when user click on locked modes then show a tiny upgrade modal.
        
- **Paraphrasing Strength Slider (Top-right)**
    - There are 4 steps: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. When the user selects a specific strength using the slider, the output will display the corresponding response.
        

---

####  **Main Panels**

##### Left Panel – **Input Field**

- Users can:
    
    - Type or paste text or try with sample text.
        
    - Upload `.pdf`  and `.docx` files
        
- Features:
    
    - Word counter (bottom-left, e.g., **39 / 180**)
        
    - Trash icon to clear the input
        
    - **“Paraphrase”** button to process the text
	    
	- If there is text in the output, it will show **"Rephrase"** button instead of **"Paraphrase"** conditionally. 
	
	-  When a user pastes any text into the input field, the system will use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to detect the type of content (e.g., Medical, Technical, Legal, etc.). Based on the detected content type, the system will paraphrase the text while maintaining proper indentation and formatting to preserve the original content structure and theme.

	- The system should detect and handle content duplication to ensure the generated paraphrased output is original and unique.

	- When users paste content with multiple paragraphs into the input section, the system must maintain the original paragraph gaps and line breaks.
    
	- Currently, multiple paragraphs merge into a single paragraph—this should be fixed to retain proper formatting.
        
- 🔒 **Freeze Word Functionality**:
    
    - When a word (like **“passed”**) is selected, a **“Please upgrade to Freeze”** tooltip appears
        
    - Only **premium users** can freeze selected words to **prevent them from being changed** during rephrasing
        

---
**Left and right side will be divided by a line.**
-  A movable divider will be placed between the input and output sections. Users will be able to drag this divider left or right to resize the input and output areas as needed. At the top of the divider, there will be a swiper icon that allows users to transfer selected paragraphs from the output section to the input section with a single click.
  
#####  Right Panel – **Output Field**

- Shows the paraphrased version after clicking **“Paraphrase”**
    
- Features include:
    
    - Highlighted words to show changed parts
        
    - Edited output is fully **interactive and editable**
        
    -   After generating the initial output, **user** can:

	- Select any part of the text
	    
	- Get **paraphrased alternatives** of that sentence or phrase
	    
	- See **synonym suggestions** for specific words

	- Replace the existing sentence/word with the chosen alternative by clicking or tapping
	
	-  In the paraphrased output, clicking on a 2–3 word phrase will show synonym suggestions. Below the suggestions, a “Break” action button will be displayed. If the user clicks “Break,” the phrase will be broken down into individual words, and the phrase behavior will be removed.
